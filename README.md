# sudoku

Web app of the popular puzzle game with backtracking solving/board generation algorithm (in progress)

## To Use

1. `git clone https://github.com/rluedde/sudoku/edit/master/README.md` (or just download repository)
2. Open `index.html` in a web brower (all browsers should be supported)!

## Future Work

* I'd like to eventually host this project on its own GitHub pages so the source doesn't have to be downloaded.

## Contributing

PRs are welcome! If you'd like to make a change, please open an issue.
